        "Above" is a randomly generated music art piece. It uses advanced
        algorithms to generate unique compositions in real time, based on random
        inputs. The music is composed of multiple layers of samples, which are
        combined and manipulated in unpredictable ways. Through its use of
        randomness and technology, "Above" offers a constantly evolving musical
        experience.

        "Vaatenurk" is an experimental generative 3D music installation. It uses
        advanced algorithms to generate unique musical compositions in real
        time, based on the movements of the audience. The music is spatialized,
        creating a multi-dimensional audio experience. Through its use of
        technology, "Above" offers a glimpse into the potential of generative
        art.

        "AudioMelt" is a music installation that explores the relationship
        between sound and visual art. It uses algorithms to convert a musical
        score into a visual image, which is then modified and transformed. The
        modified image is then sampled back into the music, creating a feedback
        loop between the audio and visual elements. "AudioMelt" blurs the
        boundaries between sound and image, creating a unique multimedia
        experience.
