        If the carrier of musical recordings nowadays is mostly a smart device,
        can a recording be "smart", dynamic and different on every listening? U:
        ran series "Residentuu:r 2022 - musical recordings" to address this
        topic and as a result three new pieces and this software were created
        for you to listen, experience and enjoy.

        Above could mean here something like - over, on high; overhead: the
        clouds above, in heaven; heavenward, in or to a higher place than; over,
        higher up, upwards. Based on material I developed in 2011-2012. The
        score consists of 6 “voices” and is for 2 or more instruments covering a
        certain pitch range. After testing different combinations, 6
        combinations were chosen for presentation in the web environment.

        "Vaaternurk" ("The Point of View") deals with the theme of individual
        versus group perspectives. Individually, one's point of view is
        presented clearly, but in a group, qualities like flexibility and
        working towards a common goal become more important. The composition is
        meant for live performance and the U:Player app, with elements of space
        and random choices playing a role in both. The piece explores the
        dominance of individualism over mutual support in society and the
        challenges of maintaining a common goal.

        "AudioMelt" is a music installation that converts audio into a visual
        representation and plays it back as a new recording. Custom algorithms
        modify and transform the visual recording, causing the music to morph
        into strange, digital and analog soundscapes. It creates a unique
        multimedia experience by blurring the boundaries between sound and
        image.
