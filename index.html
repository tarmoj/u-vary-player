        If the carrier of musical recordings nowadays is mostly a smart device,
        can a recording be "smart", dynamic and different on every listening?

        ran series "Residentuu:r 2022 - musical recordings" to address this
        topic and as a result three new pieces and this software were created
        for you to listen, experience and enjoy.

        Above could mean here something like - on high; overhead: the
        clouds above, in heaven; heavenward, in or to a higher place than; over,
        higher up, upwards. Based on material I developed in 2011-2012. The
        score consists of 6 “voices” and is for 2 or more instruments covering a
        certain pitch range. After testing different combinations, 6
        combinations were chosen for presentation in the web environment.

        "Point of View" symbolically deals with the consideration of issues from
        an individual’s and from a group’s point of view. Individually (as a solo),
        one’s visions are presented directly and clearly. In a group (ensemble),
        flexibility and working towards a common cause gain more importance. But as
        in societies individualism tends to be stronger than a group-level sense of
        community, maintaining common goals is not so easy and focus will disappear.

        This composition is meant for both the live performance and the U: player app.
        In both cases, the aspect of space and deliberate/random choice will influence
        the outcome.

        After pressing "Stop" and listening the piece again, you will hear a new rendition
        of the composition.

        It is recommended to listen with headphones.

        "AudioMelt" is a music installation that explores the relationship
        between sound and visual art. It converts a musical recording into an
        almost physical-looking visual representation, reminiscent maybe of
        vinyl grooves, and this visual representation then becomes a new
        recording itself — the music is now played back directly from that
        image. Special custom algorithms then start to modify and transform that
        visual recording, making it slowly melt and degrade, which causes also
        the music that is played back from it to slowly morph into strange alien
        soundscapes where digital and analog qualities combine. "AudioMelt"
        blurs the boundaries between sound and image, creating a unique
        multimedia experience.
