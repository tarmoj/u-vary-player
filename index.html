        If the carrier of musical recordings nowadays is mostly a smart device,
        can a recording be "smart", dynamic and different on every listening?

        ran series "Residentuu:r 2022 - musical recordings" to address this
        topic and as a result three new pieces and this software were created
        for you to listen, experience and enjoy.

        Above could mean here something like - on high; overhead: the
        clouds above, in heaven; heavenward, in or to a higher place than; over,
        higher up, upwards. Based on material I developed in 2011-2012. The
        score consists of 6 “voices” and is for 2 or more instruments covering a
        certain pitch range. After testing different combinations, 6
        combinations were chosen for presentation in the web environment.

        "Vaatenurk" ("Point of View") deals symbolically with topic
        individual – group. Individually (solo) one’s point of view is presented
        straightforwardly and clearly, sometimes with excessive eagerness and
        conviction. In a group (ensemble) qualities like flexibility and working
        towards a common goal become more important. Since the individualism is
        mostly more dominant than mutual support in our society, keeping a
        mutual purpose will not go so easily and the focus fades. The composition
        is meant for both live performance and the U:Player app. In both cases
        the element of space and random choices play an important role.
        It is recommended to listen to this piece with headphones.

        "AudioMelt" is a music installation that explores the relationship
        between sound and visual art. It converts a musical recording into an
        almost physical-looking visual representation, reminiscent maybe of
        vinyl grooves, and this visual representation then becomes a new
        recording itself — the music is now played back directly from that
        image. Special custom algorithms then start to modify and transform that
        visual recording, making it slowly melt and degrade, which causes also
        the music that is played back from it to slowly morph into strange alien
        soundscapes where digital and analog qualities combine. "AudioMelt"
        blurs the boundaries between sound and image, creating a unique
        multimedia experience.
