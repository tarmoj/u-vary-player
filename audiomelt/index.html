        "AudioMelt" is a music installation that explores the relationship
        between sound and visual art. It converts a musical recording into
        an almost physical-looking visual representation, reminiscent maybe
        of vinyl grooves, and this visual representation then becomes a new
        recording itself — the music is now played back directly from that image.
        Special custom algorithms then start to modify and transform that
        visual recording, making it slowly melt and degrade, which causes
        also the music that is played back from it to slowly morph into strange
        alien soundscapes where digital and analog qualities combine.
        "AudioMelt" blurs the boundaries between sound and image, creating
        a unique multimedia experience.
